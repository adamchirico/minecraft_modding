# Minecraft Modding

## What is this project?
This is a Minecraft mod created in Quinnipiac's Open-Source Software Development Class (CSC-375).

## How to run this project?
The setup for the process is a bit tricky, but luckily I found a YouTube video that went through it entirely, so I will link that below. To run my mod, just replace the two folders shown briefly in the YouTube video at timestamp 4:00 with my folders titled "Adams Mod" and "Mod Workspace." When you open Eclipse to run the mod, set your workspace to the "Mod Workspace" folder.

NOTE: Minecraft Modding is very version specific (I found out the hard way), so be sure to use the exact versions of software mentioned in the video.

## Documentation
All versions of the mod can be viewed at [https://github.com/adamchirico/minecraft_modding](https://github.com/adamchirico/minecraft_modding) under the `Commits` section.
